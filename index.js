//comparison operators these returns tha boolean data type
//equal ==
//not equal !=
//strict equal === (also considers the datatype)
//not strict equal !==
//greater than >
//lesser than <
//greater than or equal to >=
//less than or equal to <=
var x = 3;
var y =3;
console.log(x==y);
console.log(x!=y);
console.log(x===y); //strict equal
console.log(x!==y);//not strict equal
console.log(x>y);
console.log(true == 1); //output is true ,0 for true and false for 1

//== for loose equality, where JavaScript will coerce the types if needed.
//=== for strict equality, where types must match for the values to be considered equal
